The App graphicly displays Cell Automatons in 2 modes:
* 1D Elementar with a user-specified Rule
* 2D with rules as defined in Conway's Game of Life

After downloading download packages 
by running the following command *in project's directory* :
'python pip install -r requirements.txt'

To start the app run:
python main.py


The saved patterns are in Patterns directory.
Loading state from files is still a work in progress (like the whole app) 
so you may find some bugs if you do some unordinary stuff with them.
